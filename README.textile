h1. Outline

* Introduction

h1. Instructions for getting started:

h2. Running the classroom locally

The classroom relies on the following gems:

* @haml@
* @activesupport@
* @podium@
* @ratpack@
* @RedCloth@
* @sinatra@
* @sinatra-static-assets@

It's just a rack app, so you can run it via "shotgun":http://rubygems.org/gems/shotgun:  @shotgun configu.ru@

h2. Slides

* ...are found under @podium/slides/railsconf-2010@
* The images go under @podium/assets/images@
* Each slide is inside a @.slide@ div
* @.slide@ divs with a class of @.section@ are sections
* @.slide@ divs with a class of @.subsection@ are subsections
* Sections and subsections should have an id, like such:  @.slide.section#Main_Section@, or @.slide.subsection#Name_of_this_Subsection@.  Those ids are used to generate the section listing (which you'll see when you type @s@).
* I've added custom HAML filters, @:code@, @:rubycode@, and @:htmlcode@ for adding syntax highlighted code blocks.

h2. Workshops

* ...are found under @workshops/railsconf-2010@
* should start with a number for ordering.
* should have a README.textile file, which is used to generate the classroom page.
