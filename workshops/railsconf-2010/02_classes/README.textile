h4. Create a Library

In this lab you will be creating a library to store books.  

Create a Book and a Video class. Each of these will have a name, and will need to know if they have been checked out or not.

<pre><code class="ruby">
video = Video.new("Tom Sawyer")
book  = Book.new("Tom Sawyer")
book.checked_out? # false
book.checkout!
book.checked_out? # true
</code></pre>

Now create a class called Library.  This class will consist of the following methods:  

* @Library#add(book)@ to add books to the library
* @Library#checkout(book)@ to checkout a book
* @Library.checked_out@ that returns the items currently checked out.  
* @Library.catelog@ that returns the contents of the library.
